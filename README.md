## Development

See the [Docker Development Docs
](docker/docs/README-docker-dev.md) file for a getting started guide. This will enable development in a local Docker environment.

## Tooling

Commands:
- `composer test`
  - Run all in the `composer.json`'s `scripts.test`
- `composer lint`
  - Run Laravel Pint. Where `composer test` will not mutate files, this will.
- `composer refactor`
  - Run Rector. Where `composer test` will not mutate files, this will.
